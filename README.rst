Xandikos is a lightweight yet complete CardDAV/CalDAV server that backs onto a Git repository.

Xandikos (Ξανδικός or Ξανθικός) takes its name from the name of the March month
in the ancient Macedonian calendar, used in Macedon in the first millennium BC.

Dependencies
============

At the moment, Xandikos supports Python 3.3 and higher as well as Pypy 3. It
also uses `Dulwich <https://github.com/jelmer/dulwich>`_,
`Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_,
`icalendar <https://github.com/collective/icalendar>`_, and
`defusedxml <https://github.com/tiran/defusedxml>`_.

E.g. to install those dependencies on Debian:

.. code:: shell

  sudo apt install python3-dulwich python3-defusedxml python3-icalendar python3-jinja2

Or to install them using pip:

.. code:: shell

  python setup.py develop

Docker
------

A Dockerfile is also provided; see the comments on the top of the file for
configuration instructions.

Running
=======

Testing
-------

To run a standalone (low-performance, no authentication) instance of Xandikos,
with a pre-created calendar and addressbook (storing data in *$HOME/dav*):

.. code:: shell

  ./bin/xandikos --defaults -d $HOME/dav

A server should now be listening on `localhost:8080 <http://localhost:8080/>`_.

Note that Xandikos does not create any collections unless --defaults is
specified. You can also either create collections from your CalDAV/CardDAV client,
or by creating git repositories under the *contacts* or *calendars* directories
it has created.

Production
----------

The easiest way to run Xandikos in production is using
`uWSGI <https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

One option is to setup uWSGI with a server like
`Apache <http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Apache.html>`_,
`Nginx <http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Nginx.html>`_ or another web
server that can authenticate users and forward authorized requests to
Xandikos in uWSGI. See `examples/uwsgi.ini <examples/uwsgi.ini>`_ for an
example uWSGI configuration.

Alternatively, you can run uWSGI standalone and have it authenticate and
directly serve HTTP traffic. An example configuration for this can be found in
`examples/uwsgi-standalone.ini <examples/uwsgi-standalone.ini>`_.

This will start a server on `localhost:8080 <http://localhost:8080/>`_ with username *user1* and password
*password1*.

.. code:: shell

  mkdir -p $HOME/dav
  uwsgi examples/uwsgi-standalone.ini

Client instructions
===================

Some clients can automatically discover the calendars and addressbook URLs from
a DAV server (if they support RFC:`5397`). For such clients you can simply
provide the base URL to Xandikos during setup.

Clients that lack such automated discovery (e.g. Thunderbird Lightning) require
the direct URL to a calendar or addressbook. In this case you
should provide the full URL to the calendar or addressbook; if you initialized
Xandikos using the ``--defaults`` argument mentioned in the previous section,
these URLs will look something like this::

  http://dav.example.com/user/calendars/calendar

  http://dav.example.com/user/contacts/addressbook
