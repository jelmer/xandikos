Xandikos is a lightweight yet complete CardDAV/CalDAV server that backs onto a Git repository.

Xandikos (Ξανδικός or Ξανθικός) takes its name from the name of the March month
in the ancient Macedonian calendar, used in Macedon in the first millennium BC.

Dependencies
============

At the moment, Xandikos supports Python 3 (see pyproject.toml for specific version)
as well as Pypy 3. It also uses `Dulwich <https://github.com/dulwich/dulwich>`_,
`Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_,
`icalendar <https://github.com/collective/icalendar>`_, and
`defusedxml <https://github.com/tiran/defusedxml>`_.

E.g. to install those dependencies on Debian:

.. code:: shell

  sudo apt install python3-dulwich python3-defusedxml python3-icalendar python3-jinja2

Or to install them using pip:

.. code:: shell

  python setup.py develop

Docker
------

A Dockerfile is also provided; see the comments on the top of the file for
configuration instructions. The docker image is regularly built and
published at ``ghcr.io/jelmer/xandikos``. For each release,
a ``v$RELEASE`` tag is available - e.g. ``v0.2.11`` for release *0.2.11*.
For a full list, see `the Container overview page
<https://github.com/jelmer/xandikos/pkgs/container/xandikos>`_.

The Docker image can be configured using environment variables:

- ``PORT`` - Port to listen on (default: 8000)
- ``METRICS_PORT`` - Port for metrics endpoint (default: 8001)
- ``LISTEN_ADDRESS`` - Address to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0)
- ``DATA_DIR`` - Data directory path (default: /data)
- ``CURRENT_USER_PRINCIPAL`` - User principal path (default: /user/)
- ``ROUTE_PREFIX`` - URL route prefix (default: /)
- ``AUTOCREATE`` - Auto-create directories (true/false)
- ``DEFAULTS`` - Create default calendar/addressbook (true/false)
- ``DEBUG`` - Enable debug logging (true/false)
- ``DUMP_DAV_XML`` - Print DAV XML requests/responses (true/false)
- ``NO_STRICT`` - Enable client compatibility workarounds (true/false)

See ``examples/docker-compose.yml`` and the
`man page <https://www.xandikos.org/manpage.html>`_ for more info.

Running
=======

Xandikos can either directly listen on a plain HTTP socket, or it can sit
behind a reverse HTTP proxy.

Testing
-------

To run a standalone (no authentication) instance of Xandikos,
with a pre-created calendar and addressbook (storing data in *$HOME/dav*):

.. code:: shell

  ./bin/xandikos --defaults -d $HOME/dav

A server should now be listening on `localhost:8080 <http://localhost:8080/>`_.

Note that Xandikos does not create any collections unless --defaults is
specified. You can also either create collections from your CalDAV/CardDAV client,
or by creating git repositories under the *contacts* or *calendars* directories
it has created.

Production
----------

The easiest way to run Xandikos in production is by running a reverse HTTP proxy
like Apache or nginx in front of it.
The xandikos script can either listen on the local host on a particular port, or
it can listen on a unix domain socket.


For example init system configurations, see examples/.

Client instructions
===================

Some clients can automatically discover the calendars and addressbook URLs from
a DAV server (if they support RFC:`5397`). For such clients you can simply
provide the base URL to Xandikos during setup.

Clients that lack such automated discovery require the direct URL to a calendar
or addressbook. In this case you should provide the full URL to the calendar or
addressbook; if you initialized Xandikos using the ``--defaults`` argument
mentioned in the previous section, these URLs will look something like this::

  http://dav.example.com/user/calendars/calendar

  http://dav.example.com/user/contacts/addressbook
