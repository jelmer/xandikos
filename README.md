[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jelmer/xandikos.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jelmer/xandikos)

Xandikos is a CardDAV/CalDAV server that backs onto a Git repository.

Xandikos (Ξανδικός or Ξανθικός) takes its name from the name of the March month
in the ancient Macedonian calendar, used in Macedon in the first millennium BC.

Dependencies
============

At the moment, Xandikos supports Python 3.5 and higher as well as Pypy 3. It
also uses [dulwich](https://github.com/jelmer/dulwich),
[icalendar](https://github.com/collective/icalendar) and
[defusedxml](https://github.com/tiran/defusedxml).

E.g. to install those dependencies on Debian:

```shell
sudo apt install python3-dulwich python3-defusedxml python3-icalendar
```

Or to install them using pip:

```shell
python setup.py develop
```

Running
=======

Testing
-------

To run a standalone (low-performance, no authentication) instance of Xandikos,
with a pre-created calendar and addressbook (storing data in *$HOME/dav*):

```shell
./bin/xandikos --defaults -d $HOME/dav
```

A server should now be listening on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

Note that Xandikos does not create any collections by default. You can either
create collections from your CalDAV/CardDAV client, or by creating git
repositories under the *contacts* or *calendars* directories it has created.

Production
----------

The easiest way to run Xandikos in production is using
[uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

One option is to setup uWSGI with a server like
[Apache](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Apache.html),
[Nginx](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Nginx.html) or another web
server that can authenticate users and forward authorized requests to
Xandikos in uWSGI. See [examples/uwsgi.ini](examples/uwsgi.ini) for an
example uWSGI configuration.

Alternatively, you can run uWSGI standalone and have it authenticate and
directly serve HTTP traffic. An example configuration for this can be found in
[examples/uwsgi-standalone.ini](examples/uwsgi-standalone.ini).

This will start a server on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) with username *user1* and password
*password1*.

```shell
mkdir -p $HOME/dav
uwsgi examples/uwsgi-standalone.ini
```
